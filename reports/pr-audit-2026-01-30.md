- **#238** — Documentation enhancements. Has CI failures. May need refresh.
- **#188, #145** — Strategic/platform docs. 14-18 days stale. Consider if still aligned with current direction.
- **#172** — Blog feature with CI failures. 16 days stale.
- **#169** — PR preview environments on Fly.io. 16 days stale. CI failure.

## Potential Duplicates / Related PRs

| Group | PRs | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Community/Landing | #295, #296 | #296 depends on #295. Should be reviewed together. |
| Bridge/Multi-project | #16, #333 | #16 is the original bridge design spec (18 days stale). #333 is a newer ACP bridge implementation. #16 may be superseded. |
| Documentation | #238, #268, #145, #188 | Multiple docs PRs covering overlapping areas (protocol docs, platform docs, strategy docs). Consider consolidating. |
| Protocol/Specs | #22, #102, #111, #239 | Old spec/design PRs. Core protocol has evolved significantly since these were opened. |
