## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **tmux** installed on your system
- At least one AI CLI installed (Claude, Codex, Cursor, or Gemini)

## Installation

Install Agent Relay globally via our shell script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentWorkforce/relay/main/install.sh | bash
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
agent-relay --version
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Broker">
    The broker is the central message router. Start it first:

    ```bash
    agent-relay up --dashboard
    ```

    You should see:
    ```
    Broker started on /tmp/agent-relay.sock
    Dashboard available at http://localhost:3888
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    You can create agents two ways—via the dashboard or terminal.

    **Option 1: Dashboard (recommended)**
    1. Open the dashboard at [http://localhost:3888](http://localhost:3888)
    2. Click **Spawn Agent**
    3. Enter the name "Alice" and select CLI "claude"
    4. Click **Spawn**

    The dashboard will spawn the agent for you and you'll see it appear in the agents list.

    **Option 2: Terminal (for scripting/automation)**
    ```bash
    agent-relay spawn Alice claude "Wait for instructions"
    ```

    <Note>
      Replace `claude` with `codex` or `gemini` if you prefer a different AI provider.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Second Agent">
    Create a second agent named "Bob" using either method:

    **Dashboard:** Click **Spawn Agent**, enter "Bob", select "claude", and spawn.

    **Terminal:**
    ```bash
    agent-relay spawn Bob claude "Wait for instructions"
    ```

    You now have two agents connected to the same relay network.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Your First Message">
    In Alice's terminal, ask the agent to send a message to Bob:

    ```
    Send a message to Bob saying hello
    ```

    Alice will use the relay MCP tool to send the message:
    ```typescript
    relay_send(to: "Bob", message: "Hello! Nice to meet you.")
    ```

    The relay broker routes the message to Bob in real-time.

  </Step>

  <Step title="View the Dashboard">
    Open your browser to [http://localhost:3888](http://localhost:3888) to see the real-time dashboard.

    The dashboard shows:
    - Connected agents (Alice and Bob)
    - Message flow between agents
    - System health and metrics

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Message Formats

Agents communicate using MCP tools provided by the relay:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript Direct Message
  relay_send(to: "Bob", message: "Can you review my code changes?")
  ```

```typescript Broadcast to All
relay_send(to: "*", message: "I've finished the auth module")
```

```typescript With Thread Context
relay_send(to: "Alice", message: "[THREAD: code-review] LGTM, merging now")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Receiving Messages

When Bob receives a message from Alice, it appears in their terminal as:

```
Relay message from Alice [abc12345]: Hello! Nice to meet you.
```

The message ID (`abc12345`) can be used to read the full content if the message was truncated:

```bash
agent-relay read abc12345
```

## Common Commands

| Command                                 | Description                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `agent-relay up --dashboard`            | Start the broker and dashboard |
| `agent-relay down`                      | Stop the broker                |
| `agent-relay status`                    | Check broker and agent status  |
| `agent-relay spawn <name> <cli> "task"` | Spawn a new agent              |
| `agent-relay agents`                    | List connected agents          |
| `agent-relay read <id>`                 | Read full message content      |

## Quick Test Script

Want to see it all work together? Run this quick test:

**Option A: Dashboard (recommended)**

```bash
# Start the broker with dashboard
agent-relay up --dashboard

# Open http://localhost:3888 in your browser
# Click "Spawn Agent" and create "Alice" with CLI "claude"
# Click "Spawn Agent" again and create "Bob" with CLI "claude"
# Use the chat interface to send messages between agents!
```

**Option B: Terminal**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the broker
agent-relay up --dashboard

# Terminal 2: Spawn Alice
agent-relay spawn Alice claude "Wait for instructions from Bob"

# Terminal 3: Spawn Bob
agent-relay spawn Bob claude "Send a greeting to Alice"

# Watch the message appear in the dashboard and Alice's logs!
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Broker not running">
    If you see "Broker not running" errors:

    ```bash
    # Check status
    agent-relay status

    # Start the broker
    agent-relay up
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="tmux not found">
    Install tmux for your platform:

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install tmux

    # Linux
    sudo apt-get install tmux
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages not delivering">
    1. Verify both agents are connected: `agent-relay agents`
    2. Check agent names match exactly (case-insensitive)
    3. Ensure the message format is correct: `->relay:Name message`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied on socket">
    Remove stale socket file and restart:

    ```bash
    rm /tmp/agent-relay.sock
    agent-relay down
    agent-relay up
    ```

  </Accordion>
