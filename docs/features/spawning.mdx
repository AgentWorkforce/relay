# Worker Spawning

Lead agents can spawn and release worker agents dynamically. Workers run as separate processes with their own PTY, enabling parallel task execution with full terminal capabilities.

## Quick Start

Spawn a worker agent using the MCP tool:

```typescript
relay_spawn(name: "Worker1", cli: "claude", task: "Implement the user authentication module using JWT tokens.")
```

<Note>Spawn one agent at a time and wait for confirmation before spawning the next.</Note>

## Spawn Protocol

### MCP Tool Format

```typescript
relay_spawn(
  name: "AgentName",
  cli: "claude",
  task: "Task description for the worker."
)
```

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`    | Unique name for the worker (PascalCase recommended)    |
| `cli`     | CLI tool to use: `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor` |
| `task`    | Initial task message sent to the worker                |

## Supported CLI Tools

| CLI      | Command       | Notes                                               |
| -------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude` | Claude CLI    | Adds `--dangerously-skip-permissions` automatically |
| `codex`  | OpenAI Codex  | Adds `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`   |
| `gemini` | Google Gemini | Adds `--yolo` for auto-accept                       |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent  | Maps to `agent` command, adds `--force`             |

## Spawning Examples

### Basic Worker

```typescript
relay_spawn(
  name: "FrontendDev",
  cli: "claude",
  task: "Build the login page component with:\n- Email and password fields\n- Remember me checkbox\n- Forgot password link\n- Form validation"
)
```

### Specialized Worker

```typescript
relay_spawn(
  name: "CodeReviewer",
  cli: "claude",
  task: "Review all TypeScript files in src/ for:\n- Type safety issues\n- Error handling gaps\n- Performance concerns\nReport findings with file paths and line numbers."
)
```

## Releasing Workers

When a worker completes its task, release it to free resources:

```typescript
relay_release(name: "Worker1")
```

### Release All Workers

Release all spawned workers at once:

```typescript
relay_release(name: "*")
```

## Role-Based Agents

Define agent profiles in `.claude/agents/` for consistent configurations:

**`.claude/agents/reviewer.md`**

```markdown
---
model: sonnet
role: reviewer
---

You are a code reviewer focused on:

- Code quality and best practices
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations
```

When spawning, use the agent profile name:

```typescript
relay_spawn(
  name: "Reviewer",
  cli: "claude",
  task: "Review the authentication module for security issues."
)
```

The spawner automatically loads the matching profile and applies:

- Model selection (`--model sonnet`)
- Agent configuration (`--agent reviewer`)
- Role-specific system prompts

### Agent Profile Format

**`.claude/agents/<name>.md`**

```yaml
---
model: opus | sonnet | haiku
role: planner | worker | reviewer | lead | shadow
---
Agent-specific instructions and context.
```

## Teams Configuration

Define your agent team in `teams.json` for auto-spawning:

**`.relay/teams.json`**

```json
{
  "team": "development",
  "autoSpawn": true,
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "FrontendDev",
      "cli": "claude",
      "task": "Handle all frontend React components"
    },
    {
      "name": "BackendDev",
      "cli": "claude",
      "task": "Handle API endpoints and database"
    },
    {
      "name": "Reviewer",
      "cli": "claude",
      "task": "Review code changes before merge"
    }
  ]
}
```

Start with auto-spawn:

```bash
agent-relay up --spawn
```

Or trigger spawn manually:

```bash
agent-relay up
# Then spawn explicitly:
agent-relay up --spawn
```

## Worker Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spawn Request">Lead agent calls `relay_spawn()` MCP tool.</Step>
  <Step title="Process Creation">Relay creates PTY process with CLI and relay instructions.</Step>
  <Step title="Registration">Worker sends HELLO to broker and registers (up to 30s).</Step>
  <Step title="Task Delivery">Initial task message is sent after registration completes.</Step>
  <Step title="Work Phase">Worker operates autonomously, communicating via relay.</Step>
  <Step title="Release">Lead releases worker via `relay_release()` or worker exits naturally.</Step>
</Steps>

## CLI Commands

Manage workers from the command line:

```bash
# List all agents including workers
agent-relay agents

# View worker logs
agent-relay agents:logs WorkerName

# Kill a specific worker
agent-relay agents:kill WorkerName
```

## Dashboard API

The dashboard provides REST endpoints for spawning:

### Spawn via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3888/api/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "TestWorker",
    "cli": "claude",
    "task": "Write unit tests for the auth module"
  }'
```

### Release via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3888/api/release \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "TestWorker"
  }'
```

## Agent Limits

Worker counts are limited based on your plan:

| Plan       | Max Agents |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Free       | 3          |
| Pro        | 10         |
| Team       | 25         |
| Enterprise | Unlimited  |

The spawner returns an error when the limit is reached:

```
Agent limit reached (10/10). Upgrade your plan for more agents.
```

## Policy Enforcement

When `AGENT_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT=1` is set, spawning follows policy rules:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "Lead": {
      "canSpawn": ["Worker*", "Reviewer"],
      "maxWorkers": 5
    }
  }
}
```

Policy violations return a clear error:

```
Policy denied: Lead cannot spawn agent with name AdminBot
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Worker fails to register">
    The spawner waits up to 30 seconds for registration. Check: 1. CLI tool is installed and authenticated 2.
    No errors in worker logs: `agent-relay agents:logs WorkerName` 3. Broker is running: `agent-relay status`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Task not delivered to worker">
    Tasks are sent after registration completes. If the task is missing: 1. Verify dashboard port is set
    correctly 2. Check worker logs for errors 3. Send the task manually via messaging
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Workers crash immediately">
    Common causes: 1. CLI not authenticated (run `claude` or `codex` manually first) 2. Missing permissions
    (check `--dangerously-skip-permissions`) 3. Resource constraints (memory/CPU limits)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
