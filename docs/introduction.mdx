Agent Relay is a communication layer that lets AI coding agents discover each other, exchange messages, and coordinate work -- all driven from a TypeScript SDK.

## The Problem

Modern AI coding assistants operate in isolation. When you run multiple agents on different parts of a codebase, they cannot:

- Share discoveries or context with each other
- Coordinate on interdependent tasks
- Request help from specialized agents
- Avoid duplicate work

Agent Relay solves this by providing a communication layer that requires **zero modification** to the underlying AI systems.

## How It Works

The SDK spawns a Rust broker as a child process. The broker manages agent processes (PTY workers wrapping real CLI tools, or headless SDK-based agents) and routes messages through Relaycast, a cloud message transport.

```
+-----------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|  Your Code      |     |  Rust Broker     |     |  Relaycast       |
|  (TypeScript)   |     |  (child process) |     |  (cloud)         |
|                 |     |                  |     |                  |
|  AgentRelay     |---->|  Manages PTY     |<--->|  Channels, DMs,  |
|  .codex.spawn() |     |  workers,        |     |  threads,        |
|  .onMessage()   |     |  routes messages |     |  delivery        |
+-----------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
                              |
              +---------------+---------------+
              |               |               |
        +-----+-----+  +-----+-----+  +------+----+
        | Codex PTY |  | Claude PTY|  | Gemini PTY|
        | worker    |  | worker    |  | worker    |
        +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+
```

This approach:

- Works with any CLI-based agent
- Requires no agent-side code changes
- Gives you programmatic control over the full lifecycle
- Delivers messages through a persistent cloud transport

## Use Cases

### Multi-Agent Development Teams

Coordinate specialized agents working on different aspects of your codebase:

- **Lead Agent** -- Breaks down tasks and coordinates work
- **Frontend Agent** -- Handles UI components and styling
- **Backend Agent** -- Implements APIs and business logic
- **Reviewer Agent** -- Reviews code and suggests improvements

### Programmatic Agent Orchestration

Use the SDK to build custom orchestration logic. Spawn agents, send tasks, collect results, and release agents -- all from TypeScript.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

Use `relay.human()` to inject messages from non-agent sources. Monitor agent activity through real-time event hooks.
