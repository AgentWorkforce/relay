# agent-relay

A thin operator console for a local agent workforce: stand up the broker, staff it with off-the-shelf agent CLIs, and watch/steer them from the terminal. Each command is a shallow wrapper over a backing package (`@agent-relay/sdk`, `@agent-relay/harness-driver`, `@agent-relay/cloud`).

## Install

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npm install -g agent-relay
```

## Common commands

```bash
agent-relay status                 # workspace + cloud login + local broker
agent-relay mcp                    # MCP stdio server

agent-relay message post --channel general --text "hello"
agent-relay workspace list
```

## This machine's node

The `node` command group manages the broker on your machine and the agents it runs:

```bash
agent-relay node up                          # serves an auto-discovered agent-relay.{ts,js,…} node file,
                                             # or the implicit local node from teams.json
agent-relay node up --config ./my-node.ts    # serve a specific defineNode(...) file
agent-relay node status
agent-relay node down

agent-relay node workflow run workflows/my-workflow.ts
agent-relay node workflow logs <run-id> --follow
agent-relay node workflow sync <run-id>

agent-relay node agent new claude            # spawn + attach
agent-relay node agent list
agent-relay node agent attach <name> --mode view
agent-relay node agent release <name>
```

For AI SDK native harnesses, attach renders structured activity, text, tools, approvals, files, usage, and lifecycle events. Add `--json` for NDJSON, `--reasoning` for reasoning events, or `--diagnostics` for sidecar diagnostics. Native harness `drive` is line-oriented and acknowledged; native harness `passthrough` is unsupported because no terminal stream exists. PTY attach behavior is unchanged.

To run as a Cloud-managed node, first redeem a one-time enrollment token, then start the node:

```bash
agent-relay cloud enroll --token ocl_node_enr_...
agent-relay node up
```

`local` remains as a deprecated hidden alias of `node` (it prints a one-time warning).

Node workflow runs use Relayflows for YAML, TypeScript, and Python workflow files.

Hosted equivalents live under `agent-relay cloud …`.

## Packages

- `@agent-relay/sdk`: messaging, delivery contracts, and actions.
- `@agent-relay/harness-driver`: optional managed harness runtime.
- `agent-relay`: CLI and MCP entry point.
